#Astromech.js
A nodejs bot that understands you.

## Installation

`npm i --production`

## Run

`node index.js`

## test

`grunt`

## Why not Hubot?
Hubot's great, but it does have some limitations.  I found given those limitations we were actually writing our own integrations more than using community driven ones.  With this in mind, I wanted to design a bot from the ground up that could support natural language processing and more provide a more extensive toolkit for plugin developers.

## Official integrations
Official plugins are intended for integrating with Slack, Hipchat, IRC, etc.
